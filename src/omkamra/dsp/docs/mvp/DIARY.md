# Implementation diary

This file is an append-only progress log for implementation. The implementing agent must add one entry for each completed phase and must not edit earlier entries.

The final entry, **Handoff — current state**, is a rolling entry rather than a
completed-phase log: it records what exists, how it fits together, what is
open, and what to do next, and may be rewritten in place.

---

## P0 — Baseline (recorded before P1)

The pre-existing system was recorded as P0 in `PHASES.md`: typed portable IR,
the reference interpreter, JVM/JS/Wasm backends, scalar and fixed-size typed
state, the process ABI, and the shared `acceptance.cljc` process catalog.

---

## P1 — Integer bitwise and shift operations (completed)

**Delivered.**

- Portable IR: a single `bitwise-operators` signature table, `:bitwise` nodes
  with `:args`, lowering via `lower-bitwise`, and updated `expression-operators`
  and call inlining/substitution walkers.
- Reference interpreter: explicit 32-bit two's-complement semantics. Shift
  distances are masked to five bits and results narrowed with `unchecked-int`;
  logical right shift reinterprets the operand as unsigned 32-bit before
  shifting. This is the documented reference because Clojure's boxed `bit-shift-*`
  operate on 64-bit longs and mask modulo 64.
- JVM: `iand`/`ior`/`ixor`, `iconst-m1`+`ixor` for `bit-not`, `ishl`/`ishr`/`iushr`.
- JavaScript: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, each coerced with `| 0` so
  the result is a signed 32-bit value.
- Wasm: `i32.and`/`i32.or`/`i32.xor`, `i32.shl`, `i32.shr_s`, `i32.shr_u`, with
  `i32.xor` by `-1` for `bit-not`.
- Linker `language-forms` and descriptor `expression-type` recognize the seven
  operators.
- Shared `acceptance.cljc`:
  - process case `:bitwise-lfsr`, an integer recurrence exercising all seven
    operators across interpreter, JVM, JS, and Wasm in both precisions;
  - function-entry cases for the seven operators plus float arithmetic,
    comparisons, boolean logic, `while`/`break`/`continue`, and conversions.
- `omkamra.dsp.browser`, a spel-based Clojure driver that starts
  `:on-demand-http`, opens `omkamra.dsp.testbed` with `?autorun=0`, and calls the
  page's `runConformance` hook.
- `omkamra.dsp.testbed/run-conformance!`, a programmatic browser entry point
  returning a structured `clj->js` result; the testbed now also runs the shared
  function-case matrix on JavaScript.

**Verified.**

- Clojure/JVM suite: 60 tests, 612 assertions, 0 failures.
- Browser conformance through `omkamra.dsp.browser/run!`: 15/15 checks, covering
  the process acceptance matrix (f32/f64 JS and Wasm), the JS function-case
  matrix (f32/f64), bounded-loop Wasm traps, generated modules, and all four
  AudioWorklet adapters.
- Direct Node runs of the emitted JavaScript and of WABT-compiled Wasm matched
  the interpreter bit-for-bit on the LFSR and on a bitwise-process fixture.

**Incidental fixes.**

- JVM functions with `:boolean` parameters boxed `Long` instead of `Integer`,
  so any reflected invocation of such a function failed. Exercising a boolean
  parameter through the shared catalog exposed and fixed this.
- The shared `ushr32` reference returned an unsigned JavaScript number; the DSP
  `:int` result is the signed 32-bit reinterpretation, so the reference now
  narrows with `| 0`.

**Deferred.** The Wasm backend remains process-only, so function-entry cases
run on the interpreter, JVM, and JavaScript. Wasm coverage for the same
operators is provided by the `:bitwise-lfsr` process case.

---

## P1 follow-up — per-case target breakdown in the browser result

The browser conformance result now makes the JavaScript/Wasm split visible
instead of reporting only an aggregate pass/fail. The shared matrices carry
`:targets` and a per-case `:cases` vector, for example
`{:case :gain :precision :f32 :javascript true :wasm true}` for the process
matrix, and `:targets [:js]` with JavaScript-only entries for the function
matrix. `omkamra.dsp.browser` keywordizes the keys and the enumerated values
(`:case`, `:precision`, `:targets`) so the result is idiomatic Clojure.

`TESTING.md` documents how to read the breakdown. Verified through
`clojure_eval` against the running nREPL: browser 15/15, JVM 60 tests / 612
assertions.

---

## P2 — Portable scalar math builtins (completed)

**Delivered.** The capability-aware `omkamra.dsp.builtins` registry and a
generic `:builtin` IR node; primitive lowerings on interpreter/JVM/JS/Wasm via
multimethods; derived `clamp`/`fract`/`sign`/`round`/`mod` expanded with
per-argument temporaries; the D9–D12 semantics; and D12 total wrapping integer
`/`/`rem`/`mod` across all targets.

**First library entries.** `omkamra.dsp.library` (`.cljc`) is the seed of the
P7 standard library: `clip` and `triangular-window`, written in the DSP
language with `dsp/defn` and composed from `min`/`max`/`abs`, plus the catalog
cases `:library-clip` and `:library-triangular-window` that call them through
the ordinary call mechanism on every target. The namespace is `.cljc` on
purpose: the JVM compiler expands `dsp/defn` today, and an SCI-hosted browser
compiler will expand the same source forms once the front end is portable
(P13). It was verified to compile under ClojureScript as well, with the
correct captured `:namespace`.

**Conformance rewrite.** `omkamra.dsp.acceptance` is now pure data, and
`omkamra.dsp.conformance` builds target-neutral plans. The reference
interpreter became portable (`interpreter.cljc`) and now runs in the browser,
so the browser computes expected outputs from the served IR instead of trusting
vectors shipped from the JVM. `omkamra.dsp.browser` drives the page with spel
and `:on-demand-http`; `omkamra.dsp.testbed` serves a `plan` endpoint.

**Verified.** JVM 59 tests / 445 assertions; browser 8/8 (27 process cases ×
f32/f64 on JS and Wasm, 13/3 function cases on JS, bounded-loop trap, three
AudioWorklet adapters).

**Negative zero, resolved.** The browser oracle briefly had to treat `+0`/`-0`
as equal because ClojureScript's `PersistentArrayMap.-assoc` short-circuits on
`identical?` (`===`), and JavaScript says `0 === -0`, so `assign`-ing `-0.0`
over a `+0.0` local kept the old sign. Locals now go through `set-local!`,
which drops the key first on ClojureScript to force a genuine insertion. The
`:sign` case regression-tests it, and the browser comparison is strict again.

**Open.** The capability check is still only implicit: a backend's
`builtin-instructions`/`emit-builtin` `:default` throws a structured error for
an unimplemented `[operator type]`. Every P2 builtin is supported on every
target, so nothing exercises a richer capability model yet; P3 is where the
first genuine gap (Wasm transcendentals) appears. Separately, the Wasm f64
AudioWorklet check was dropped in the rewrite, and function-entry cases remain
JavaScript-only. See the handoff entry below for detail and next steps.

---

## P3 — Transcendental math intrinsics (completed)

**Decision.** `DECISIONS.md` D14: compile to a native intrinsic wherever one
exists, emulate where it does not, and put the resulting deviation in a
**target-dispatched matcher** rather than in the oracle. The interpreter stays
the single oracle and uses the host `Math`, so it counts as a native target;
Wasm, whose core has no transcendental instructions, gets an f64-internal
emulation emitted as WAT. The matcher is exact by default and tolerant only on
`:wasm`.

**Landed (first slice: `exp`, `sin`, `cos`).**

- `exp`, `sin`, `cos` are primitive builtins (`omkamra.dsp.builtins`).
- Native lowerings: the interpreter uses `Math`/`js/Math`, the JVM `Math`
  through the existing `double-transcendental-instructions` helper (f32
  promotes to f64 and narrows), JavaScript `Math`.
- Wasm emulations (f64, fixed size): `exp` reduces by `k = nearest(x*log2e)`
  and builds `2^k` from the f64 exponent field by bit construction; `sin`/`cos`
  share one quadrant reduction (`n = nearest(x*2/pi)`, `|r| <= pi/4`, Taylor
  polynomials, quadrant `n mod 4` selects and negations). `\u00b1inf` and NaN
  cannot reach the i64 conversion, so they are replaced and their results
  forced to NaN with `select`.
- Emulated builtins are emitted once as shared f64→f64 Wasm functions
  (`$dsp_sin`, `$dsp_cos`, `$dsp_exp`) and `call`ed from each use site, so
  module size no longer multiplies with call sites: `sin`/`cos` went from
  ~78 KB to ~19.5 KB and `exp` from ~14.6 KB to ~5.2 KB, and each extra `sin`
  call site now costs ~93 bytes instead of re-emitting the whole expression.
- Compiler option `:wasm-math` selects the Wasm emulation strategy:
  `:polynomial` (default) or `:table`.
- Wasm lookup table (`:table`, f32 only): one shared 4097-entry f32 sine table
  in a `(data ...)` segment, read with linear interpolation, used by
  `$dsp_sin` and `$dsp_cos` (`cos` via a π/2 phase shift). f64 keeps the
  polynomial because a table accurate enough for f64 would be far larger than
  the code it replaces. The table WAT text is ~53 KB (16 KB of payload) but a
  lookup is a handful of ops against a degree-13 polynomial.
- Matcher: `conformance/scalar-match?` and the browser `scalar-match?` dispatch
  on target; `:wasm` allows `1e-6` (f32) / `1e-9` (f64) relative tolerance,
  and every other target stays exact.
- Catalog cases `:exp`, `:sin`, `:cos`, so the shared process matrix is now 30
  cases.
- A browser check, **Wasm sin lookup table f32**, renders the `:table` kernel
  and compares it to the interpreter within tolerance.

**P3 done-when met.** `omkamra.dsp.library` now defines a `sine-oscillator`
(phase accumulator wrapping at 1.0) and an `exponential-adsr` (per-sample
one-pole segments over attack/decay/sustain/release, with threshold-based
stage changes because an exponential approach only reaches its target in the
limit), written only in DSP source. The catalog has `:sine-oscillator` and
`:exponential-adsr` cases; a case may name a user-facing library Var with
`:definition-var` instead of inlining a descriptor, and the JVM side resolves
it when building the plan. Both render within tolerance on
interpreter/JVM/JS/Wasm for f32 and f64.

**Cross-cutting fix: constant precision.** Float literals were narrowed to a
Clojure `Float` during IR lowering regardless of the artifact's precision.
That lost f64 precision, and because a `Float` prints a short decimal it did
not round-trip through the EDN served to the browser: Java widens `Float`
`6.2831855` to `6.283185482025146` while JavaScript reading the EDN number
`6.2831855` gets `6.2831855`. The oscillator's `2*pi` constant exposed it as a
browser-only f32/f64 mismatch. Literals now stay `double` in the IR and are
narrowed per precision at use: the interpreter's `:const`, the JVM
`(float ...)`, the JS `Math.fround`, and the Wasm `<f32/f64>.const`.

**Full operation set.** The other ten landed: `tan`/`sinh`/`cosh`/`tanh`
derive from the shared `sin`/`cos`/`exp` functions; `log` (mantissa/exponent
split by bit reinterpretation, then `log(m) = 2*atanh((m-1)/(m+1))`) and
`atan` (four argument halvings then a Taylor series) are the two new accurate
building blocks; `asin`/`acos`/`atan2`/`pow` derive from those. Emulation
bodies may now carry WAT locals and statements, which is also what keeps them
bounded: before that, `atan`'s halving loop duplicated its argument three
ways per step and produced 430 KB of WAT; a scratch local brought it to 3 KB.

**Verified.** JVM 59 tests / 475 assertions; browser 9/9, with all thirteen
P3 operations, plus `:sine-oscillator` and `:exponential-adsr`, passing on
JavaScript and Wasm at f32 and f64, and the table strategy exercised.

**Trap avoided.** The first emulation computed `exp(x/2^20)` and then squared
it twenty times by nesting `(f64.mul p p)`. Nesting duplicates the expression
tree, so the WAT grew as 2^20 copies of the polynomial and killed the dev
server with an out-of-memory. `exp` now uses exponent bit construction and
stays fixed-size; every future emulation must do the same.

**Deferred.** The `:wasm-math :table` lookup-table lowering is still an
optimization with a pending benchmark (see the TODO below); it does not block
the phase.

## P4 — Local arrays, constant tables, aggregate state (completed)

P4 extends the language from scalar locals and flat state arrays to fixed-size
memory for delay lines, wavetables, and structured filter state. It is being
delivered as vertical slices.

### Slice 1 (P4a) — local arrays and the instance scratch arena

**Surface.** `(array :float N)` / `(array :int N)` declares a fixed-size local
array as a `let` binding. Indexed access is `(aget a i)` / `(aset a i v)`, with
`array-load` / `array-store` kept as equivalent aliases (Clojure-core names per
D3). An array name is not a scalar value; using it directly is a diagnostic.

**One arena.** A real-time kernel cannot allocate per call, so a local array is
not created inside `process()`; it is **preallocated scratch**. Scratch slots
get distinct logical offsets that continue immediately after persistent state,
and the arena is realized in each backend's existing storage: the flat array for
the interpreter, the typed arrays for JVM and JavaScript, and one linear-memory
region for Wasm. Because `state`, `scratch`, and the per-backend layout
functions are shape-identical, the load/store code paths are shared: JVM/JS/Wasm
route `:array-load`/`:array-store` through the same `case` branches as
`:state-load`/`:state-store`. No method signature or ABI parameter changed.

**Semantics.** Scratch is zero at instance creation and a declaration emits no
run-time statement, so its contents persist between frames: a scratch array must
be written before it is read within a frame. Each declaration owns a distinct
slot (lifetime-based aliasing is deferred). Constant indices are checked while
lowering; dynamic indices are checked at run time by the interpreter and flagged
by a `:dynamic-array-index` diagnostic. Local arrays require the `:process`
entry, like state. `reset` restores state only, never scratch. Recorded as
**D15**.

**Landed through the full pipeline.** Descriptor/linker (the three forms are
language forms), portable IR (`:array-load`/`:array-store` nodes, `:scratch`
slots, `:dynamic-array-index`), the reference interpreter (arena allocation and
runtime bounds checks), JVM, JavaScript, and Wasm (a `:scratch` memory region in
the plan), plus four shared catalog cases: `:local-array`, `:local-array-int`,
`:local-array-dynamic` (uses the `aget`/`aset` aliases), and
`:local-array-with-state` (scratch offsets continue after state). The ABI now
exposes `:scratch` and `:scratch-layout` next to `:state`/`:state-layout`.

**Latent bug found (out of scope).** A sample-to-int conversion in an early
int-array case exercised `float->int` of infinity, which throws in the
interpreter (`logical-int`) while JVM `d2i` saturates — the special-value
conversion contract is still open (`PLAN.md`). The case was made
control-driven to avoid it; the divergence is recorded under open issues.

**Verified.** JVM 61 tests / 495 assertions; browser 9/9 (the process matrix
now covers the four array cases on JavaScript and Wasm at f32 and f64).
`clj-kondo`/`cljfmt` clean.

### Slice 2 (P4b) — aggregate records as named structs

`dsp/defstruct` binds a named field-shape to a Var (shorthand bare field names,
explicit descriptors, or an options map), and a state slot references it with
`:name slot :struct shape` plus an optional `:size` for an array of records.
The **linker** resolves the reference through the declaring namespace's captured
resolution — the same path calls use — and inlines the fields, keeping the
fully-qualified id as `:struct-name`. Inline `:fields [...]` is accepted for
one-off records. Access is `field`/`set-field!`, with an optional leading record
index, or the Clojure-style `(:field record)` / `(record :field)` reads and
`(set! (:field record) value)` write; the linker treats a record-name-headed
form as field access rather than a call.

Records are laid out **struct-of-arrays**: the field tree flattens to scalar
leaves, each leaf becomes one flat state entry of `:size N`, and record `i` of
leaf `j` sits at `leafOffset(j) + i`. Every leaf is therefore an ordinary
`state-load`/`state-store` with a constant base and the record index as the
element index, so the four backends are unchanged. This is D16.

### Slice 3 (P4c) — constant tables and layout metadata

`:constant true` marks a table or record read-only: it is materialized at
initialization and every store to it is rejected while lowering. The ABI now
exposes `:records` and `:arena` (region offsets, element size, alignment), the
Wasm state layout marks constant entries, and a `:dynamic-state-index`
diagnostic joins `:dynamic-array-index`. Float `:init` values stay double in the
IR (narrowed per precision at use), so an f64 table survives the EDN round trip
to the browser; the earlier `(float value)` narrowing was the last place
carrying a `Float`.

### P4 complete

All six deliverables are in: local arrays (1), aggregate records (2),
initialization-time constant tables (3), explicit layout/alignment metadata (4),
development-time bounds checks and unproven-index diagnostics (5), and
primitive-array / linear-memory lowering with no allocation after
initialization (6). Generated-target (JS/Wasm) *development guards* remain a
tracked optimization: the reference interpreter is the development-time
checker, and `PLAN.md` still notes the generated-target gap.

**Final verification.** JVM 62 tests / 511 assertions; browser 9/9, with the
process matrix covering local arrays, inline and `:struct` records (scalar,
nested, and arrays of records), and a read-only constant table on JavaScript and
Wasm at f32 and f64. `clj-kondo`/`cljfmt` clean.

---

## P5 — Delay lines, circular buffers, and interpolation (completed)

Circular-buffer delay lines are written in the DSP language on top of the P4
arena and exercised by the catalog. The convention is D17: a persistent `:float`
buffer plus an `:int` cursor, **write then read** each frame, and wrapped indices
via the floored `mod`.

**Library.** `omkamra.dsp.library` gains the stateless helpers
`linear-interpolate` and `allpass-coefficient`, and two reusable **processes**
that own their state: `delay-line` (64-sample line, linearly interpolated
fractional tap) and `allpass-delay-line` (same line, first-order allpass tap).
Each holds its whole state in one **record that owns its buffer**
(`{:name line :fields [{:name buffer :type :float :size 64} {:name cursor ...}]}`),
accessed with `(aget line k)`/`(aset line k v)` and `(:cursor line)`. Processes
rather than functions because the call mechanism still rejects stateful
callees — that is P6.

**Catalog vectors.** `:delay-line-zero` (zero delay is the identity),
`:delay-line-unit`, `:delay-line-fractional` (4.5), `:delay-line-wrap` (30.25,
which wraps the 64-sample buffer over the run), and `:allpass-delay-line`. All
run through the shared matrix on the interpreter, JVM, JavaScript, and Wasm. A
readable JVM test pins the convention with an impulse: delay 3.0 moves the
impulse to sample 3, delay 3.5 splits it 0.5/0.5 across samples 3 and 4, and
zero delay is the identity.

### P4 follow-up — records can own their buffers

P5 needed a record to own a buffer, so the P4b omission was closed:

- a field in a **scalar** record may declare `:size M` (an array field), so a
  record is `{buffer, cursor, ...}` rather than the buffer being a separate
  top-level state array. An array of records cannot yet contain an array field
  (rejected with a diagnostic); that nested case stays for P6/P10 voices.
- the accessors gained the missing element index: `(aget rec k)`/`(aset rec k v)`
  index a record's single array field, and `(field rec :buf k)` /
  `(set-field! rec :buf k v)` is the explicit spelling. Selectors are
  `[record-index?] field-name+ [element-index?]`, so the leading index selects a
  record and the trailing one an array element.
- as a side fix, a control port that declares a non-default type (e.g. `:int`)
  now types its local, so `[sample index]` with `{:controls [{:name index :type
  :int}]}` works instead of silently making `index` a float.

### P5 follow-up — static array places (D18)

`(:line rec)` / `(field rec :line)` with no element index is now a **place** — a
compile-time reference to storage — and `(aget (:line rec) k)` /
`(aset (:line rec) k v)` index it. Places also arise from a local array, a
top-level state array, a record name with a single array field, and a `let` alias
of any of these (`(let [buf (:line rec)] (aget buf k))`). A place used where a
scalar is expected is a diagnostic. No backend changed: a place lowers to
`state-load`/`state-store` with a constant base offset. This is a strict subset
of first-class arrays — places are static, so passing/returning them and runtime
bases (into an array of records) remain P6. The `:array-place` catalog case
exercises the place form and a `let` alias on all four targets.

**Verified.** JVM 65 tests / 545 assertions; browser 9/9. `clj-kondo`/`cljfmt`
clean.

**Deferred.** The library line length is fixed at 64; a delay of `N` aliases by
design. Length *parameterization* needs compile-time capacities/modules, which is
P6's territory rather than an ad-hoc mechanism here.

---

## Handoff — current state after P5 (rolling entry)

This is the one living entry, as opposed to the completed-phase entries above:
what exists, how it fits together, what is open, and what to do next. It may be
rewritten in place. Read with `PLAN.md`, `PHASES.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`.

### Where things stand

- **P1 (integer bitwise/shift) is complete.** The seven operators exist across
  interpreter/JVM/JS/Wasm per `DECISIONS.md` D3.
- **P2 (portable scalar math builtins) is complete**, including the
  capability-aware registry, the D9–D12 semantics, and the first standard
  library entries (`omkamra.dsp.library`).
- **P3 (transcendentals) is complete** under D14 (native intrinsic per
  target, emulation fallback, target-dispatched matcher). All thirteen
  operations are done end to end on interpreter/JVM/JS/Wasm; the `:wasm-math`
  option selects the Wasm emulation strategy (`:polynomial` or the f32
  `:table`); and the library's `sine-oscillator` and `exponential-adsr`
  render on all four targets.
- **P4 (local arrays, records, constant tables) is complete** under D15/D16.
  `(array :float|:int N)` declares preallocated scratch; `aget`/`aset` (or
  `array-load`/`array-store`) index it. `dsp/defstruct` names a record shape,
  referenced with `{:name slot :struct shape}` (plus `:size` for arrays of
  records) and accessed with `field`/`set-field!`; the linker inlines the
  fields, laid out struct-of-arrays in the same arena as state and scratch. A
  scalar record may own an array field (`:size M`), indexed with `(aget rec k)`
  or `(field rec :buf k)`. `:constant` tables are read-only and materialized at
  initialization. The ABI exposes `:records` and `:arena`.
- **P5 (delay lines, circular buffers, interpolation) is complete** under D17
  and D18. The library provides `linear-interpolate`, `allpass-coefficient`, and
  the `delay-line` / `allpass-delay-line` processes; the convention is a
  persistent buffer plus an `:int` cursor with write-then-read ordering and
  floored `mod` wrap. Array storage is a static *place* (D18), so a record owns
  its buffer and `(aget (:buf rec) k)` / `let` aliases index it. Catalog vectors
  cover zero, unit, fractional, wrap, allpass, and the place form.
- **The conformance harness is interpreter-oracle-driven** (D7/D13): the shared
  catalog is pure data, and the reference interpreter is the single oracle on
  the JVM *and* in the browser.
- **North star:** users eventually edit DSP definitions in the browser
  (CodeMirror) and compile them there, which means the compiler itself becomes
  portable and runs in SCI (P13). The library and every new language form are
  therefore authored as portable `.cljc` source forms.
- Verified through `clojure_eval` on the running nREPL: JVM 65 tests / 545
  assertions, browser 9/9 (the process matrix covers the P4 array/record/table
  cases and the P5 delay-line and place cases on JavaScript and Wasm),
  `clj-kondo`/`cljfmt` clean.

```

### Interpreter-oracle conformance

- A **plan** (`conformance/plan`) is target-neutral data: the compiled portable
  IR, controls or function vectors, and the invocation sequence (blocks, reset,
  special values). It contains **no expected outputs**.
- **JVM:** the interpreter computes expected outputs; the JVM backend is
  compared against it (`interpreter-oracle-conformance` in `dsp_test.clj`).
- **Browser:** `/omkamra/dsp/testbed/plan` serves the plan; the page reads the
  EDN IR with `cljs.reader`, runs the bundled `.cljc` interpreter to compute
  expected, runs the generated JavaScript/Wasm kernel, and compares.
- Adding a test is now **data-only**: append to `acceptance/process-cases` or
  `acceptance/function-cases`; both suites pick it up automatically.
- Comparison is exact, NaN-equal-as-NaN, and signed-zero-aware on both the JVM
  and the browser.

### P2 builtins

- Registry: `omkamra.dsp.builtins` (data + small pure fns, ready to become
  `.cljc`). Each entry has `:operator`, `:kind` (`:primitive`/`:derived`),
  `:signatures` overloads, `:effects`, and `:expand` for derived ops.
- IR: primitives lower to a generic `{:op :builtin :builtin ... :args [...]}`
  node; derived ops expand during lowering, binding each argument to a fresh
  local so effectful arguments are evaluated once.
- Backends use multimethods dispatched on `[operator type]`
  (`builtin-instructions`, `emit-builtin`).
- Contract: D9 (`min`/`max` NaN-propagating, signed-zero-aware), D10 (`round`
  half-away, derived), D11 (small primitive set), D12 (integer `/`, `rem`,
  `mod` total and wrapping), D13 (registry + `:builtin` node).

### Standard library

- `omkamra.dsp.library` is the `.cljc` seed of the P7 library. `clip` and
  `triangular-window` are written with `dsp/defn` and compose builtins only.
- The library is `:clj`-required by `acceptance.cljc` so the JVM linker can
  resolve the calls; the browser only receives compiled IR and never loads it.
- Fully-qualified symbols (`omkamra.dsp.library/clip`) are used in catalog
  bodies so no alias/`:resolution` plumbing is needed in hand-built data.
- It is deliberately one namespace for now; P7 will decide the sub-namespace
  seams (`omkamra.dsp.library.<category>`).

### Open issues

1. **Capability diagnostics are implicit.** There is no registry-level,
   pre-flight capability check; an unimplemented `[operator type]` fails in the
   backend's `:default` method at emission time. P2's builtins are supported
   everywhere, so nothing exercises a richer model yet. P3 (Wasm has no
   `sin`/`cos`/`exp`/`log`) is where this should be made explicit.
2. **Reduced browser coverage from the rewrite.** The old suite had separate
   generated-kernel and Wasm-module checks plus a Wasm f64 AudioWorklet check;
   those were folded into the shared matrix or dropped. The Wasm **f64**
   AudioWorklet adapter is no longer exercised. Re-add if desired.
3. **Function-entry cases are JS-only.** Wasm is process-only by design, so the
   function matrix runs on interpreter/JVM/JS; Wasm coverage for the same
   operators comes from process cases.
4. **Non-finite sample-to-int conversion is undefined across targets.**
   `float->int` of NaN/infinity throws in the interpreter but saturates on the
   JVM (`d2i`), with JavaScript/Wasm behavior of their own. The conversion
   special-value contract is still open (`PLAN.md`); P4 hit it through an
   int-array test and routed around it.

### Gotchas burned into this session

- In Clojure/CLJS source, `-0` is **integer zero**; negative zero is `-0.0`.
- Clojure's `(float x)` **throws** on infinity; use `unchecked-float` (JVM) and
  `unchecked-float`/`Math.fround` (CLJS).
- ClojureScript `unchecked-remainder-int` is **floored** (it uses `mod`); use
  `rem` plus explicit `int32`. `unchecked-divide-int` may not narrow
  `INT_MIN / -1`; wrap with `int32`.
- Do not name a parameter `case` — it shadows the `case` special form in CLJS.
- **ClojureScript's map `assoc` short-circuits on `identical?`/`===`**, so it
  loses a `+0.0` → `-0.0` (or reverse) value change because `0 === -0` in JS.
  Force a fresh insertion (`dissoc` first) whenever signed zero matters.
- Avoid `:reload-all` in the dev JVM (it reloads `clojure.core.async` and
  breaks the running Shadow server). To refresh `omkamra.dsp-test`, use
  `(remove-ns 'omkamra.dsp-test)` then `(require 'omkamra.dsp-test :reload)`,
  because `:reload` alone leaves removed `deftest` vars behind.
- A `:reload` flag placed mid-list — `(require 'a :reload 'b :reload)` — does
  not reliably reload every namespace, and a stale served catalog shows up as a
  browser 500 for a case the server does not know. Reload explicitly:
  `(doseq [n [...]] (require n :reload))`.
- `spel`'s bundled Playwright wants a different Chromium revision than the
  installed one; `omkamra.dsp.browser/installed-headless-shell` finds the
  installed headless shell and passes it as `:executable-path`.
- The Shadow watcher sometimes reports `0 compiled`; call
  `omkamra.dev.frontend/recompile!` and re-check. Dev assets are served with
  `cache-control: no-store` now.

### Next steps

1. Begin **P6 — stateful module composition**: typed multi-input/multi-output
   module definitions with explicit state, buffers, and update ordering, and a
   defined policy for calling stateful and buffer-accessing callees (which P5
   worked around by using library *processes*).
2. Keep a structured diagnostic for any operation a target cannot serve at all.
3. Optionally add generated-target (JS/Wasm) development guards and restore the
   dropped Wasm f64 worklet checks.

### Wasm lookup table — done, with follow-ups

Steps 1 and 2 are done (shared emulation functions; f32 sine table via
`:wasm-math :table`). Remaining:

- **Benchmark** the table against the polynomial before changing the default;
  `:polynomial` is still the default.
- **f64**: a raw table would be too large; consider a piecewise minimax
  coefficient table if f64 Wasm speed ever matters.
- **`exp`** has no table (polynomial only); fine while it is not hot.
- **Table size**: 4097 f32 entries (16 KB payload, ~53 KB WAT text). Could
  shrink to 2049 entries if the interpolation error stays acceptable, or grow
  for margin.
- **Cos** currently reuses `$dsp_sin` with a π/2 phase shift; acceptable for
  the tested ranges but a direct quarter-period offset would be more accurate
  for large arguments.

### How to run everything

See `TESTING.md`. Short version, through `clojure_eval`:

```clojure
;; JVM
(require '[clojure.test :as t] 'omkamra.dsp-test)
(t/run-tests 'omkamra.dsp-test)

;; Browser (JS + Wasm)
(require '[omkamra.dsp.browser :as browser])
(browser/run!)
```
